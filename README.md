# Typing speed tester

This is a project to determine the typing speed and accuracy of a user. A UI will be created using the Tkinter and phrases will be retrieved from a database using SQL. Additonally, this program has been threaded for one thread to deal with the UI and the other for input processing.

## What is the purpose of this project?

This project has been created to create a program to test and experiment with the Tkinter package for creating a UI. Additionally, I want to consolidate my knowledge of threading in python so will be adding this functionality.

## To do list:

 * Comment exisiting code that has not been.
 * Convert the file into a multi-file system to make it more modular.
 * Create a unittesting file that will be used to test functions to ensure they're working correctly.
 * Improve the accuracy measures that the program returns to the user. (Look at individual words and characters)
 * Change the basic UI to a more functional and more visually pleasing one.
